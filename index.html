      <h1>Hi! ^^</h1>
      <h2>I'm a web developer, currently on high school.</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="textbody">
      <ul> Things About Me:
        <li>I'm an beginner guitarrist, I have the amp and the eletric guitar, of course. I also want a normal guitar though, to play some more acoustic type of stuff.</li>
        <li>As I've said on the subtitle, I'm a (intermediate?) web developer, started learning HTML and CSS back in 2020 with my online friends, they're really cool. :)</li>
        <li>And besides being a webdev, I also know a <mark style="font-size: 5pt">little bit</mark> of JavaScript; I have an idea of how the code is made, but sometimes it's not the most "orthodox" way of doing it, if you know what i mean, lmao</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <ul>Hobbies:
        <li>I <mark style="font-style: italic;">love</mark> music, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5DYCXL3vZDPNpCBCOYLc81?si=ed86e83ec995409f" target="_blank">listening to great songs</a> of course.</li>
        <li>I like to play games, sometimes. I play Roblox, Minecraft, Hearts of Iron 4, etc.</li>
        <li>I know how to make/edit videos! Probably my strongest, since I know how to make videos, I of course have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP3W7YdSj6oYte9Pa3K1nmg" target="_blank">Youtube channel!</a></li>
        <li>But the thing I know the most is probably editing and making images, learnt it from my sister, whom is a designer. So because of that I know how to use Photoshop; recently I started to use GIMP, faster than Photoshop tbh, and I recommend GIMP.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <ul>Additional Note
        <li>I am planning to make a band called M82, Progressive Rock band, mixed with some other genres too. I am also hiring a drummer and a bassist for the band.</li>
        <li>If you're interested on joining my band, text to me on my Discord! Serious messages only, please (Dead Memories#8688).</li>
