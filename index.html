      <h1>Hi! ^^</h1>
      <h2>I'm a web developer, currently on high school.</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="textbody">
      <ul> Things About Me:
        <li>I'm sometimes all alone, no one to talk and stuff, and I don't really like it to be honest, so maybe, <mark title="Dead Memories#8688">you can hit me up?</mark> It would be really cool if we could chat :)</li>
        <li>As I've said on the subtitle, I'm a web developer, bad one (in my opinion), and I don't think any real web developers out there would disagree with it.</li>
        <li>And besides being a webdev, I also know a <mark style="font-size: 5pt">little bit</mark> of JavaScript, I mean, I can think of the code, like how it would be made, <mark title="Maybe I have some potential... right?">but I just can't make it.</mark></li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <ul>Hobbies:
        <li>If I weren't clear enough, I fucking love music, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5DYCXL3vZDPNpCBCOYLc81?si=ed86e83ec995409f" target="_blank">listening to great shit</a> of course.</li>
        <li>I like to play games, sometimes. I play Roblox, Minecraft, Insurgency Sandstorm, Hearts of Iron 4, etc.</li>
        <li>I know how to make/edit videos! Probably my strongest, making videos and editing images... Since I know how to make videos, I of course have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP3W7YdSj6oYte9Pa3K1nmg" target="_blank">Youtube channel!</a></li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <ul>Additional Note
        <li>I am planning to make a band called M82, Progressive Rock band, with some other genres too, of course. I am also hiring a drummer and a bassist for the band.</li>
